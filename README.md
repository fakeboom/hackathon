the game is live at: http://burstpoint.yuzu-swap.com/
we were about to name the game 'rugpull' just to be ironic about things happened in the past 2 months in the crypto world. 
just like any rugpull schemes in the field, the return will become higher block by block, and after a random number of blocks, it will suddenly busted and return to zero. so if a player managed to escape before the 'rugpull', they will actually win, but if they didnot manage to escape before the 'rugpull', they will lose what they bet. 
the game is now set to 110 blocks for each epoch, the first 10 blocks is for players to take bets and set the number of blocks they want to auto-escape, when the game starts, say a player bets 1 ROSE, after X blocks, the return will be X ROSE, of coz if its before the 'rugpull' happens, player who choose to escape manually or auto, will get X ROSE from the smart contract, those who didnot choose to escape until 'rugpull' happens will end up nothing, the max payout will be 100x, and the 'rugpull' number is random in each epoch. ppl can only join during the first 10 blocks of each epoch, otherwise they have to wait till the epoch is over. (for easier demo, we've changed the online test version to 20 blocks each epoch, otherwise the wait time could be quite long for testers.) players can only bet 1% of the amount that the smart contract holds. (for instance, if the smart contract has 100ROSE, players can only bet 1ROSE just to make sure that if player hits 100x, they will get paid, so plz try with very small number, dont wipe the house out:) ). 
its a simple game with lots of possibilities, ppl could also bet with YUZU or FTP in the future, or become the house themselves.
